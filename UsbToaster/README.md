#### USB Toaster

This is a Windows executable that runs in the system tray (AKA taskbar) and displays toaster notifications for USB insertion and removal events.

I used the https://github.com/mohabouje/WinToast library to do the toaster notifications. It requires Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to display notifications. Personally I hate the Windows 10 notifications design, and prefer to use custom popup notification windows that fade in and out with alpha transparency.
